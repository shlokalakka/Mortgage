      "assessment": "The use of numbered steps and visual aids helps readability significantly.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Explain terms like 'custom segment' in simple language before jumping into filter options.",

      "assessment": "Mostly action-oriented and instructional, but inconsistent phrasing in headers.",

        "Standardize headers to use verbs: e.g., 'Create a Segment' instead of 'Segment Creation'.",
        "Replace vague phrasing like 'Click on Analytics' with 'Click on the Analytics tab in the top menu.'"
